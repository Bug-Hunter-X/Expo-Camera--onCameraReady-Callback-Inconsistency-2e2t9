This bug occurs when using the Expo Camera API with a custom `onCameraReady` callback.  The camera might not initialize correctly, and the `onCameraReady` callback might never be called, leading to a seemingly blank screen or an error in the subsequent camera operations.  This issue is particularly tricky to debug because it often appears intermittently and doesn't always produce clear error messages in the console.
