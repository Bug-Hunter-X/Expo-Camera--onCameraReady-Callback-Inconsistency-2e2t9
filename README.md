# Expo Camera: onCameraReady Callback Inconsistency

This repository demonstrates a bug related to the Expo Camera API's `onCameraReady` callback.  The callback sometimes fails to trigger, leading to a non-functional camera component.  This issue has been observed on both iOS and Android platforms.  The `bug.js` file contains the problematic code, while `bugSolution.js` offers a potential workaround.

## Problem

The `onCameraReady` callback provided to the Expo Camera component may not always fire. This inconsistency makes it impossible to rely on this callback for initializing camera-related operations.   The root cause remains unclear, but potential contributing factors include device-specific hardware or software variations, and asynchronous operations within the Expo Camera API.

## Solution (Workaround)

The proposed solution in `bugSolution.js` involves a fallback mechanism that uses a `setTimeout` to handle the case when `onCameraReady` does not fire within a reasonable timeframe. This workaround addresses the symptom but does not solve the underlying cause of the inconsistency.  A more robust solution will require further investigation and potentially updates to the Expo Camera API itself.

## Reproduction Steps

1. Clone this repository.
2. Run `npm install` to install the project dependencies.
3. Run the application using `expo start`.
4. Observe the behavior of the camera component, noting instances where the camera may fail to initialize or where subsequent operations result in errors.
